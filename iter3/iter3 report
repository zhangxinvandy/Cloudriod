In this iteration, we worked on setting up the django API that returns a list of reports associated with the user. The detailed description and cooresponding results can be viewed in the same folder.

In order to view analysis result, we will investigate how to link our API with existing APK platform and make it respond to our request.

The remaining user story will focus on add more test corner cases to enrich available functionalities of developed package.
